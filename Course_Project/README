This script merges the training and test Samsung datasets contained in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder, to create a new data set.
It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
It uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and also transforms labels to descriptive variable names, 
by supressing special characters.
Then it creates a dataset named "DF" containing the information metioned above and also creates a second data set named "DF_avg"
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Finally, both datasets are written to files "DF.txt" and "DF_avg.txt" in the current directory 

- Code_Book.txt
It contains general information about the DF_avg dataset

- Fields.xlsx
It shows detailed information about every field contained in the file DF_avg.txt
