This script Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
It uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and transforms labels to descriptive variable names, 
by supressing special characters.
Then it creates a dataset named "DF" containing the information metioned above and also creates a second data set named "DF_avg"
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Finally, both datasets are written to files "DF.txt" and "DF_avg.txt" in the current directory
